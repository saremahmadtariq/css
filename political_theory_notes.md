# POLITICAL THEORY BY ANDREW HEYWOOD

###### The slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. ~ gorge Orwell, 'Politics and the English Language'

> SLOVENLINESS : means that the flexibility of our languages can make it easier for us to have or create foolish thoughts in peoples mind and in our own head also.

> A **paradoxical** statement is a one that looks wrong, self-contradictory or illogical and is intentionally crafted to make one think deeper.

> **literal** means clear as the words say, but satirical is the one having hidden meaning.

> A **satirical** statement is one that uses irony, sarcasm, ridicule or the like, in exposing, denouncing or deriding vice, folly, etc.

###### If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who allows him self to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person ~ Oscar Wilde, An Ideal Husband

> The meaning a **word** carries is defined by who it is spoken by and how much power that person has.
